# ToDo_List_Manager
This is a simple to-do list manager that utilizes localStorage functions to allow for persistent lists

This was built with the utilzation of FreeCodeCamp tutorials and resources, as well as extensive use of W3Schools webpage

I would like to eventually add an alert popup on the first visit that takes in a username for the list and stores it along with the data to allow for a more personalized list.
